### Kim Kiamco ðŸ‘‹

  I am a full stack web developer, I love making web applications. I am also an indie developer so often times I try to think of different projects to work on. I am passionate about turning ideas into quality web applications. My current tech stack is JavaScript and React.js on the front end, on the back end I like switching it up with Python3 or Node.js. Sometimes I also program with plain vanilla Javascript when I'm bored. Currently, Im working on this web application that will give independent designers a platform to sell their handmade products. I also know cloud technologies like AWS, I am always excited to learn new things. Check out my portfolio at kiamco.dev
